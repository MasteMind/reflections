Q> When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
				When there is a group of more than one person, working on the same project but on the different aspects. Another case can be when the project is an open-source one and I wish to get contribution from other programmers all over the globe.
Q> Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
				Because, at times there might be some changes that aren't made by me or there might be some changes that I have made in the local repository that i havent committed yet. IN those cases, automatic pulling might make me loose important changes.

Q> Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
				Fork is used when we need to clone someone else's repository and wish to continue working on it ourselves. Clone is used when we desire to make a copy of any repository from git hub to our local computer, or vice-versa. Branching is used in the cases where the project is to be divided and further continue into two different phases or by two different contributors.
